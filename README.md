## Blender2Bloodborne

This is a toolset for extracting Bloodborne models. I try to keep pipeline as close to Blender as possible

1. Get Bloodborne PS4 files üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è
2. Downlad [PS4 PKG Tool](https://github.com/pearlxcore/PS4-PKG-Tool/releases/tag/v1.5)
3. Open Bloodborne_Game.pkg with it. PKG Content ‚Üí View PKG Content ‚Üí Wait... ‚Üí right click Image0 ‚Üí Extract to. (I use'll folder "extracted") The app may seem to stuck. It simply doesn't have loading screen. Wait 10-20 mins
4. Download [BinderTool](https://github.com/Atvaark/BinderTool/releases)
5. Go to extracted/dvdroot_ps4/map. Drag-n-drop any *.dcx file on BinderTool.exe
  - *.tpf.dcx will create another *.tpf.dcx
  - *.flver.dcx will create *.flver
6. Use ./utils/BloodborneTools. It was originaly hosted on [XENHAX](https://zenhax.com/viewtopic.php?f=5&t=7006&sid=8cd60cb622907a6a69e92d882328d4b8). But mediafire may remove it in the future, so here's a duplicate
  - Drag-n-drop *.flver on BloodBorne_model_v3.exe. It will create *.smd and *.ascii
  - Drag-n-drop *.tpf.dcx on Bloodborne_texture.exe. It will create *.dds and *.dx10
7. Install [Blender XPSTools](https://github.com/johnzero7/XNALaraMesh/releases/tag/v2.0.2) plugin
8. Blender ‚Üí File ‚Üí Import ‚Üí XNALara / XPS ‚Üí XNALara/XPS Model (.ascii/.mesh/.xps)
