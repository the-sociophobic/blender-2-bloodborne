## Blender2Bloodborne

This is a toolset for extracting Bloodborne models. I try to keep pipeline as close to Blender as possible

1. Get Bloodborne PS4 files üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è
2. Downlad [PS4 PKG Tool](https://github.com/pearlxcore/PS4-PKG-Tool/releases/tag/v1.5)
3. Open Bloodborne_Game.pkg with it. PKG Content ‚Üí View PKG Content ‚Üí Wait... ‚Üí right click Image0 ‚Üí Extract to. (I use'll folder "extracted") The app may seem to stuck. It simply doesn't have loading screen. Wait 10-20 mins
4. Download [BinderTool](https://github.com/Atvaark/BinderTool/releases)
5. Go to extracted/dvdroot_ps4/map. m21, m22, m23 folders are for textures. m21_00_00_00, m22_00_00_00, m23_00_00_00 are for models (I guess). Drag-n-drop any files on BinderTool.exe[^1]
    - *.tpf.dcx will create another *.tpf (texture)
    - *.flver.dcx will create *.flver (model)
    - filename_0.tpfbhd then filename_0.tpfbdt. It will create a folder with lots of *.tpf (textures archive)
6. Use ./utils/BloodborneTools. Tools were originaly attached to [XENHAX](https://zenhax.com/viewtopic.php?f=5&t=7006&sid=8cd60cb622907a6a69e92d882328d4b8) post. Attached via URL to some old cloud storage. So I duplicated them to this repo, just in case[^2]
    - Drag-n-drop *.tpf on Bloodborne_texture.exe. It will create *.dds and *.dx10
    - Drag-n-drop *.flver on BloodBorne_model_v3.exe. It will create *.smd and *.ascii
7. Install [Blender XPSTools](https://github.com/johnzero7/XNALaraMesh/releases/tag/v2.0.2) plugin
8. Blender ‚Üí File ‚Üí Import ‚Üí XNALara / XPS ‚Üí XNALara/XPS Model (.ascii/.mesh/.xps)

[^1]: I should write a script to recursively unpack all this. It has -r flag. But it fails to work with .tpfbhd .tpfbdt files
[^2]: I should write a script to recursively unpack all this. Also convert all *.dds and *.dx10 to *.png. Rewrite texture paths in all *.ascii

Also worth mentioning. Options I found and tested. May be it will be useful for your pipeline
  - [Yabber](https://www.nexusmods.com/sekiro/mods/42). Can be used as *.dcx packer / unpacker on step 5
  - [FLVER_Editor](https://github.com/asasasasasbc/FLVER_Editor). Works as drag-n-drop *.flver viewer. Can export to *.dae. But messes up verticies positions a bit
  - [Blender Source Tools](http://steamreview.org/BlenderSourceTools/). For opening *.smd files. Not needed in current pipeline
  - [DarkSoulsModelViewerDX](https://github.com/soulsmods/DarkSoulsModelViewerDX). Some 2019 proj C# source code. No builds. [Description](https://www.reddit.com/r/darksouls/comments/ab5a5y/darksoulsmodelviewerdx_a_new_model_and_map_viewer/)
  - [Blender FLVER plugin](https://github.com/elizagamedev/blender-flver). Wasn't working
  - [UXM Selective Unpacker](https://github.com/Nordgaren/UXM-Selective-Unpack) works for all Souls except Bloodborne
